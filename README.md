# Network_TCP
## shortcoming
1. The `TCP_Server` component doesn't allow multiple clients to connect at the same time for now!
2. The `TCP_C` and `TCP_S` components are relying on the Grasshopper `trigger` component to continuously display the received message.

## Welcome for any improvement advice !
